<h2> 💻 💼 About Me : </h2>
Hello and welcome!

I am an ML Scientist at NASA with 5+ years of expertise in AI/ML algorithm design and deployment. I excel in developing advanced machine learning and neural network models for processing and analyzing images and time series data. I work closely with engineers and scientists across the organization to deliver impactful and innovative solutions in space and engineering technologies.

I love how machine learning has leveraged our life. Over the past four years after my PhD, I had this great opportunity to work on a variety of exciting projects ranging from deploying and training ML models, analyzing telescope datasets to visializating the findings and reporting them to technical and non-technical audiance. This way I share the joy of having insights driven from the data with others.
