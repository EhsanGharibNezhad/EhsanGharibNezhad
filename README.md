<h2> 💻 💼 About Me : </h2>
Hello and welcome!

I'm a passionate __Data scientist__ at NASA space administration. I love how machine learning has leveraged our life. Over the past four years after my PhD, I had this great opportunity to work on a variety of exciting projects ranging from deploying and training ML models, analyzing telescope datasets to visializating the findings and reporting them to technical and non-technical audiance. This way I share the joy of having insights driven from the data with others.

<h2>🪚🔧 𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐬𝐤𝐢𝐥𝐥s:</h2>

The first programming language I learned in academia was __Fortran__ which I used for doing my class projects in undergrad. However, after I started my PhD,   __Python__ became my daily language as it is extremely versatile and it enables implimenting complex tasks such as training classifiers and regressors as well as generate statstical models. 

Below is a list of some of the skills that I've gained throughout my 10+ years of experience of working as a research scientist at Arizona State University and then as a __data scientist__ at NASA. As I'm a fond of __Python__ and its packages, I have also created open scource libraries and online tutorials which you could check in the following: 

▪ **Programming Languages/Tools**: Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, SQL

▪ **Data Manipulation/ Visualizations/ Documentation**: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Bokeh, Sphinx

▪ **ML/ Deep Learning**: XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), DNNs

▪ **Statistics**: Bayesian optimization (MCMC), Time series analysis,  Predictive/Descriptive statistics
